	* csrspmv.c: add an option for precomputing first and final rows
	for each thread for the load-balanced SpMV kernel (csrgemvnz)

2023-03-14  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	* csrspmv.c: add a missing barrier for the CSR SpMV with balanced
	nonzeros (csrgemvnz) to ensure that the execution time and
	performance is accurately displayed.

2023-03-08  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	* csrspmv.c, ellspmv.c: use _OPENMP instead of WITH_OPENMP to
	check for OpenMP support.

2023-03-02  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	add compile-time options for selecting 32- or 64-bit integers for
	row/column offsets (i.e., compile with -DIDXTYPEWIDTH=32 or
	-DIDXTYPEWIDTH=64)

	allow matrices and vectors with integer and pattern fields by
	converting integers to doubles or by setting the double
	precision floating-point matrix/vector values equal to one.

	align allocations to page boundaries if HAVE_ALIGNED_ALLOC is
	defined

	add a CSR SpMV kernel where nonzeros are partitioned evenly among
	threads

2023-02-28  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	add option for reading gzip-compressed Matrix Market files.

2023-02-22  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	* csrspmv.c: add an analogous implementation of matrix-vector
	multiply for matrices in CSR format.

2023-02-10  James D. Trotter  <james@simula.no>

	* ellspmv.c: add option for separating diagonal and offdiagonal
	entries, which is a common trick that may improve SpMV
	performance.

	also, print a range of throughput, where the minimum is based on
	loading column vector entries only once, whereas the maximum is
	based on loading column vector entries every time. (This is a
	measure of effective throughput and does not account for entire
	cache lines of column vector entries being loaded and some of
	those values not being used. The true throughput of data traffic
	in the memory hierarchy may be even higher than the effective
	throughput due to loading entire cache lines at a time rather than
	single column vector entries.)

	add options for reading x and y vectors from file, and use
	standard output for printing results.

        Add A64FX cache partitioning directives for Fujitsu C compiler.
